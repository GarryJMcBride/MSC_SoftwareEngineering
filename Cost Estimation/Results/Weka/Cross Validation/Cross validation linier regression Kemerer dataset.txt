Cross validation linier regression Kemerer dataset:

Weka does stratified cross-validation by default. And with 10-fold cross-validation, Weka invokes the learning algorithm 11 times, one for each fold of the cross-validation and then a final time on the entire dataset. ... It depends on the number of classes in your dataset.
